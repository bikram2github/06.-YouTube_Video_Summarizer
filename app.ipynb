       "\"Hello all, my name is Krishna and welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys, I am super excited to start this new series on one of the most important technique which is right now being used in genative AI and agentic AI field that is nothing but rag. If you don't know the full form of rag, it is called as retrieval augmented generation. In this specific video, we will try to understand what exactly is rag. uh what are the disadvantages of just using the LLM model and how we are overcoming those disadvantages with the help of rag when should we use rag and what are the important pipelines that we should take a note while developing a rag application okay so all this topics we will be discussing and as we go ahead we are going to implement each and every important pipelines with the help of Jupyter notebook and I will also show you with the help of modular coding Right. So both the ways we will try to implement it. Now why I'm stressing on this specific series because nowadays every companies are looking for professionals who are who knows how to build rag applications because if you see various AI engineering reports there many of the companies around 60 to 70 projects percentage of the projects are specifically on rag application. So let me quickly go ahead and share my screen and start discussing about rag. This is just the introduction video of rag. Uh and as we go ahead we'll be implementing more amazing examples. So let me quickly go ahead and show you. So this is a simple definition that uh I've put up over here and uh in this definition first of all we'll try to understand rag. Okay. So first of all let's go through the definition and then I will give you a brief idea what exactly rag is all about you know. So here you can clearly see that rag is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model. Okay. So it references an authorative knowledge base outside of it training data set source before get generating a response. LLMs are trained on vast volume of data as we all know and use billions of parameters to generally original output for task like question answering, translating and completing sentences. Rag extends the already powerful capabilities of LLM to specific domain or an organizational internal knowledge base all without the need to retrain the model. Okay. It is cost- effective approach to improve LLM output. So it's relevant, accurate and useful in various context. So this is just a basic definition. You can refer to this particular definition. So guys, now let's go ahead and understand about rag. So let's consider that I have a generative AI application. And as you all know in a generative AI application, usually let's say that I have an LLM. So this is my LLM. Now usually whenever we have a LLM what happens is that let's consider that I have a user a user is asking a query. So this is a my query from the user and before it is sent to the LLM we do add a prompt right we do add a prompt and this prompt is just like an instruction to the LLM like how the LLM should work okay and then based on this we actually get an output now this is a simple generative AI application wherein the LLM is used to generate the content Okay, generate the content. So obviously by using this specific technique we give a query and this LLM you know that it has been trained with billions of data okay different kind of data that is available in the internet and based on this it will be able to generate the output. One of the disadvantage of this let me talk about the disadvantage of this particular approach. As you know that every LLM that is trained you know it will be trained for a specific set of data. So let's say right now it is 31st August. Okay 31st August. Let's say this is my LLM model and this is basically GPT5 which is the recent model from OpenAI. Now as you know that when this model was launched this model may be trained by may be trained with data till 1st August. Okay. So this LLM will not have any idea what has basically happened in the current world between 1st to 31st August. Right? And let's say if I go ahead and ask a specific question to the LLM which is between this specific dates for any kind of events the LLM will start hallucinating. So one of the major disadvantages of only using the LLM is that it will hallucinate. Okay. When we say hallucinating what does this basically mean? It means that even though it does not have the knowledge what has happened between 1st August to 31st August any events even though we ask any question the LLM will try to generate it own answer because it does not want to look like a fool. Okay, that is the best example. It does not want to look like a fool. So it will try to generate some answers and it will make sure that it will it'll show you answer that you may also have to believe it. that is how it will be written you know in in terms of the output that we get so usually this condition is basically called as hallucinating okay so this is one of the major disadvantage the second disadvantage that you have so let's say that I'm using this LLM and you know this LLM has been trained with huge amount of data now what happens is that I'm running a startup let's say now in my startup I'm solving a specific use case and I have some data which again I need to use this particular data along with my LLM. Okay. So let's say that I have some other data like you know um policies policies of my company I have HR policies of my company I have finance policies you know and this policies all will not be available in the it will not be available publicly because it is my startup so these all data has been protected now I also want to use this specific data and probably create a chatbot okay now how do I do this now one way is that many people will say hey kish we can take this particular data and we can fine-tune the model right we can simply fine-tune the model yes this is a very good solution but understand fine-tuning a model is a very expensive process very tedious process because this LLM whichever LLM we are using it has billions of parameter and tweaking this billions of parameter usually takes a lot of time Right? So obviously this is a solution but this is a very expensive solution. Okay. Now do we have any other way any other way and remember these all policies and these all data will also keep on getting updated as we run the startup. Right? So every time we cannot just go ahead and fine-tune it like every day we not fine-tune it. Right? So we should try to find out a solution like how do we prevent this? So this can again be prevented with the help of rag. Right? Now how it will be prevented with the help of rag I will talk about it. Okay. So here instead of fine-tuning I'm saying that hey I will go ahead and implement the rag. Now you'll understand only when we understand the pipeline of the rag which I will discuss in this specific video. Okay. Now these are the major two disadvantages that you see right over here and yes there are some more disadvantages which we'll just deep dive more as we go ahead. Okay now what happens in uh if we use rag and how we are preventing it. See rag is nothing but it is it is saying that is a process of optimizing the output of a large language model. So it references an authorative knowledge base outside of his training data. Now how do we solve this hallucinating and this problem that we have okay so let me just go ahead and draw the diagram again okay so here is my llm okay and here is my query so let's say that uh I am coming up with an user query so let's consider it over here okay and here I'm drawing a user I'm user okay and this user will first of all give a query. Okay. Now what happens is that there will be two important pipelines that will be created. As I said over here we are trying to optimize the output of a large language model. So it references an authorative knowledge base outside of it training data source. So as you all know this is my LLM right? This LLM is already trained with huge amount of data. Now along with this I will be having an external database and this database we basically say it as vector database. Okay external vector database. Now you you know that this LLM is already trained with some amount of data and any additional data let's say my startup data my policies HR finance whatever data is there we will try to create a data injection pipeline over here data injection pipeline over here now what will be this data injection pipeline so let's say I have my data from this data we will do some kind of parsing and from this parsing we will do embeddings embeddings and then we finally store it into the vector store. Okay. Now whenever we talk about this specific data this data can be in any format. It can be in PDF format. It can be in HTML format. It can be in Excel format. It can be even in SQL database format or unstructured format any format. So what we do initially we take this data and we do data parsing. Now here data parsing is a very important step. I think if you crack this step then developing a rag application becomes very easy. Data parsing is all about how do you read the unstructured data or the structured data that is present inside this and how do you chunk this data right how do you chunk how do you divide this specific data into chunks chunking is very important because you need to save this data inside some kind of vector store this is nothing but vector store or vector DB okay now vector store and vector DB is nothing but it will actually help you to save vectors inside this. Okay. So once you do the chunking after doing the chunking you pass it to the embedding models. Now here in the embedding models you basically convert text to vectors. Okay. Vectors is just like a numerical representation for text so that you will be able to apply algorithms like similarity search cosine similarity techniques that are already available right wherein similar kind of results based on a specific query can be retrieved from this particular databases. Okay. So here whenever I talk about vector DB this is my vector DB or vector store here we are storing embeddings. Okay. And this embeddings will get applied to every chunks. Embeddings is nothing but we basically use we convert text into vectors. Here we can use different different embeddings like Google Germany embedding models. We can use open AI embedding models. We can use hugging phase embedding models and each and every embedding models exist with different different cost and there are also open-source embedding models which will actually help you to convert the text into vectors. Now this is one specific pipeline which we call it as data injection pipeline. At the end of the data injection pipeline you are able to store the text into vectors inside your vector DB. Now how rag is different from the previous one. Right? So initially you had this data injection pipeline where you are converting all your data into vectors. Right? And this data is specifically for this particular startup. And now I have created a knowledge base. So this is my knowledge base. External knowledge base or internal knowledge base whatever knowledge base I have and this knowledge base does not exist with this LLM. Right? Yes, some amount of information may be available but not the entire part. Now see the definition. It is a process of optimizing the output of a large language so that it references an authorative knowledge base outside of this training data. Now what will happen when user gives a query? Now this query instead of directly going to the LLM will go to this vector database right and before going here also we need to go ahead and apply embedding right because this query will be converted into vectors right why we need to convert into vectors so that when we are hitting this query to the vector DB this similarity search is basically applied and based on this we get some kind of context we get some information from the vector DB and now whatever query I'm asking okay if I ask hey what is the leaf policy of my company right now what will happen first of all it'll go to the vector store it will gather all the related information that is available over here and that information when it is sending it to the llm it is called as context Now we use this context along with we go ahead and write a specific prompt. Now this prompt is an instruction to the LLM and it says that you can use this context to answer the question and finally you get a output. This is the entire pipeline. This pipeline is basically called as retrieval pipeline. Retrieval pipeline. And this is a very good example of a traditional rag. Now you may be thinking kish what about other types of rag. Don't worry thumb don't worry I will explain it completely from basic to advanc with implementation each and everything because later on we'll be discussing about agentic rags. We'll be discussing how agentic rags actually work each and everything. But I hope you got an idea with respect to this. Now here you will even not be seeing this particular problem like you'll not completely remove hallucination but some amount of hallucination if any queries that is asked related to the data that is present in the vector DB I will definitely get some kind of context and my LLM will give me the output as let's say that if that data is not present over here then LLM can hallucinate right but here we are doing this see one best example that you can do is that you can use perfectly Perplexity. Perplexity is nothing but it is based on rag. It is completely developed based on rag applications. Okay. Rag it is it is a kind of a rag application. In perplexity you have connected to various retrievers. You are connected to tools. You are connected to web search right and then it is summarizing the output and giving by the LLM. Right? and it also uses various LLMs itself. I'm also planning to mostly start a startup soon enough within a couple of weeks I guess and the kind of application that I'm developing is a rag application only and it solves a very good problem for a developer. Okay. So that is the reason I'm not being able to upload a lot of videos because I'm pretty much involved in those startups and working and developing a product that India can definitely remember. Okay. And this is how you know this is this is this is how things are and you can basically see how good uh you know the pipeline actually works and this is basically a traditional rack. Now you may be thinking what all things we'll be discussing. Okay fine we have discussed about a traditional rack in the future classes what coding we'll be doing. Okay so let's go ahead and talk about it. As I said two important pipelines we'll go ahead and create one is a data injection pipeline and one is a retrieval pipeline. Okay. Now in the data injection pipeline you'll be see seeing that we will be performing data injection. Along with the data injection we will go ahead and do data parsing. Then we'll perform embeddings. Then uh we will store everything into the vector store. Then we will create a retriever for this and whenever a user ask any queries it will be able to give the context to the LLM and then finally we will be generating the output. So here this is retrieval this is auggmentation right this is augumentation over here augmentation basically means what you're giving a context to the LLM along with the prompt to generate the output right so this is basically called as augmentation and finally you're generating the output right which is nothing but generation so here you are basically generating now in the next session how we are going to implement it first of all I will show you how to perform these two steps in a very efficient way. Okay, sorry not these two steps. I will show you how we can perform these all steps, right? Data injection, data parsing and embedding. Here we are going to consider different different files like PDF, HTML. Okay. Um PDF, HTML, you can consider Excel, you can consider SQL database, you can consider any kind of files. Then we'll do document parsing and we will try to convert this into document. So document is an amazing data structure which you can basically use it and you can even parse this do the chunking and store it in the vector embeddings sorry vector store. Then we'll perform embeddings. Here we will use both open source and we are going to use paid embeddings for the same. Okay. And then finally we go to the vector store. Then based on a user query, how do we go ahead and apply the same embeddings we are going to see that okay and then finally we'll be developing this. So mostly I really want I'm I'm focusing more on making bigger videos so that you don't just follow a playlist. Okay. I want to basically cover a lot of stuff in one video so that uh you should also be able to efficiently cover it instead of covering 50 different videos. Right now when we are doing data injection and data parsing right there are various techniques see we are going to see about optimization we are going to see about various chunking strategies context engineering these all kind of topics will be coming up when we talk about data parsing you know u what is semantic chunker you know how do we go ahead and do the chunking in those strategies and all everything we'll try to discuss as we go ahead but I hope you got a very super cool idea about what exactly is rag um Yeah, this was it from my side. Uh please make sure to like the video, share with all your friends and uh soon within couple of days we'll come up with the next video wherein we will be starting the coding tutorial and we'll start building this data injection pipeline and I will try to build it in the form of a project uh that it'll be looking good for you so that you'll also be able to completely implement things right. So yes, this was it from my side. I'll see you in the next video. Thank you. Take care.\""

      "Krishna introduces a new YouTube series focused on Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG), a key technique in generative and agentic AI. The first video explains what RAG is, why it’s important, the problems it solves for large language models (LLMs), and outlines the two core pipelines—data injection and retrieval—that will be implemented in later tutorials.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Points**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What RAG Is**  \n",
      "   - RAG optimizes LLM output by referencing an external, authoritative knowledge base that isn’t part of the model’s training data.  \n",
      "   - It extends an LLM’s capabilities to specific domains or internal corporate data without retraining the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Limitations of Using LLMs Alone**  \n",
      "   - **Hallucination**: LLMs generate plausible but incorrect answers when they lack up‑to‑date or domain‑specific knowledge.  \n",
      "   - **Data Currency**: Models are static; they can’t incorporate new events or internal documents after training.  \n",
      "   - **Fine‑tuning Costs**: Updating a model with new data is expensive and impractical for frequent changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **How RAG Addresses These Issues**  \n",
      "   - By storing up‑to‑date documents in a vector database, the system can retrieve relevant context for any query.  \n",
      "   - The LLM then uses this context to produce accurate, grounded responses, reducing hallucination.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Core Pipelines**  \n",
      "   - **Data Injection Pipeline**:  \n",
      "     - Parse various file types (PDF, HTML, Excel, SQL, etc.).  \n",
      "     - Chunk the text into manageable pieces.  \n",
      "     - Convert chunks into embeddings using models (OpenAI, Google, Hugging Face, or open‑source).  \n",
      "     - Store embeddings in a vector store.  \n",
      "   - **Retrieval Pipeline**:  \n",
      "     - Convert a user query into an embedding.  \n",
      "     - Search the vector store for the most similar chunks.  \n",
      "     - Supply retrieved context to the LLM via a prompt.  \n",
      "     - Generate the final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Future Content**  \n",
      "   - Upcoming videos will dive into coding the data injection and retrieval pipelines in Jupyter notebooks, covering parsing, chunking strategies, embedding choices, and vector store integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Supporting Details**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Krishna cites industry reports showing 60‑70 % of AI projects involve RAG, underscoring its commercial relevance.  \n",
      "- He uses a concrete example: a startup with proprietary HR and finance policies that cannot be publicly shared. Fine‑tuning would be costly; RAG allows the policies to be queried in real time.  \n",
      "- The video references Perplexity as a real‑world RAG application that combines web search, summarization, and LLM generation.  \n",
      "- Krishna plans to build a startup around a RAG product for developers, explaining his limited video output.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Takeaways**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **RAG is essential** for making LLMs reliable in specialized, up‑to‑date contexts.  \n",
      "- **Two pipelines**—data injection and retrieval—form the backbone of any RAG system.  \n",
      "- **Embedding and vector stores** are the technical glue that connects raw documents to the LLM.  \n",
      "- **Fine‑tuning is not the only solution**; RAG offers a cost‑effective, flexible alternative.  \n",
      "- **Upcoming tutorials** will provide hands‑on code for building these pipelines, making the concepts actionable.\n"

इसीलिए डेटाबेस को लाया गया और ये यह सिक्योर्ड होता है हमारे डाटा को सिक्योर्ड रखता है जब जरूरत पड़ेगी हमें एक्सेस करके देगा हम मॉडिफिकेशन परफॉर्म कर सकते हैं अपडेट कर सकते हैं सारी चीजें हम परफॉर्म कर सकते हैं डेटाबेस के थ्रू अपने डाटा में अब हम डिस्कस करेंगे व्हाई डेटाबेस केम ठीक है डेटाबेस को क्यों लाया गया तो सबसे पहले आप यह जान लो कि डाटा स्टोर का टेक्निक क्या होता है क्या-क्या टेक्निक होता है डाटा स्टोर करने का यानी हम कितने तरीके से अपने डाटा को स्टोर कर सकते हैं तो पहला तरीका होता है जो कि सबसे पह पहले आया था बुक्स एंड फाइल्स सिस्टम बुक्स एंड फाइल सिस्टम में हम डाटा बुक्स के फॉर्म में स्टोर करते थे एक नोटबुक में फिर आया फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम क्योंकि इसमें कुछ ड्रॉबैक था तो फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम में क्या हुआ कि कंप्यूटर के अंदर हम फाइल के फॉर्म में डाटा रखते थे फिर इसमें भी कुछ ड्रॉबैक था तो फिर आया डेटाबेस ठीक है तो इसीलिए डेटाबेस को लाया गया क्योंकि इन दोनों में कुछ कमी था तो अभी बुक्स एंड फाइल सिस्टम क्या होता है यहां पे हम डिटेल में आपको बता देते हैं इट वाज द अर्लिया मैकेनिज्म अडॉप्टेड बाय ऑर्गेनाइजेशन टू स्टोरिंग द इंफॉर्मेशन ऑर्गेनाइजेशन पहले अपने इंफॉर्मेशन को स्टोर करने के लिए बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम का इस्तेमाल करते थे क्योंकि हमारे पास कंप्यूटर नहीं थे तो जब कंप्यूटर नहीं था तो हम लोग क्या करते थे नोटबुक के अंदर डाटा स्टोर करते थे प्रैक्टिकली हम शो करेंगे कैसे करते थे लेकिन यहां पे अभी देखो करेंटली इट इज नॉट इन यूज ड्यू टू फॉलोइंग ड्रॉबैक्स अभी इसका इस्तेमाल नहीं होता क्यों नहीं होता क्योंकि मेंटेनेंस प्रॉब्लम होता है इसमें सिक्योरिटी प्रॉब्लम होता है रिक्वायर्ड मोर मेन पावर कॉस्टली इन मेंटेनेंस ठीक है यहां पे आप कर सकते हैं कि रिट्रीवर में भी प्रॉब्लम होता है डाटा को रिट्रीव करने में भी प्रॉब्लम आता है तो इन सभी प्रॉब्लम्स की वजह से बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम को क्लोज किया गया तो अभी चलो प्रैक्टिकली इन ड्रॉ बैक को हम आपको शो करके दिखा रहे हैं कि यह क्यों क्लोज हुआ आप यहां पे देखो स्टूडेंट डिटेल्स हमारे पास कुछ स्टूडेंट का डिटेल्स है बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम में कैसे स्टोर होता था इस तरीके से नोटबुक में हम क्या करते थे सीरियल नंबर रखते थे उनका नेम रोल नंबर ईमेल कोर्स जो भी हमारे पास डाटा होता था इस तरीके से हम एक नोटबुक में रखते थे ठीक है बुक्स में बुक्स के अंदर इसीलिए इसका नाम है बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम तो इसमें ड्रॉबैक क्या है मान के चलो कि हमें डाटा रिट्रीव करना है बहुत सारे डाटा है तो फाइंड करने में मुश्किल होता था ठीक है अब मान लो हमारा ये बुक भुला गया ठीक है खो गया तो ये डाटा भी हमारा लॉस्ट हो जाएगा या फिर इसमें मान लो किसी भी तरीके का किसी ने ये पेज ही मान लो गायब कर दिया इस पेज में हमने डाटा रखा हुआ है ये पेज किसी ने बुक से हटा दिया तो हमारा डाटा तो ऐसे ही चला जाएगा और इसमें मेंटेनेंस का भी प्रॉब्लम होता था कि मान लो कुछ मॉडिफिकेशन करना है इस डाटा में तो इस तरीके से काट के मॉडिफिकेशन करना होता था ठीक है तो इन सभी रीजन के वजह से बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम को अब इस्तेमाल नहीं किया जाता है बुक एल फाइन सिस्टम को इस्तेमाल इस नहीं किया जाता क्योंकि इसमें बहुत सारे ड्रॉबैक थे ठीक है और इसमें डाटा रजिस्टर में स्टोर होते थे अगर आप पुरानी मूवीज वगैरह में देखे होंगे तो रिसेप्शन में जब भी कोई इंक्वायरी होती थी तो रजिस्टर निकाल के दिया जाता था वहां से डिटेल्स एक्सेस किया जाता था ठीक है अब हम बात करेंगे फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम के बारे में यह हमारा सेकंड टेक्निक है डाटा स्टोर करने का तो यह क्या होता है व्हेन कंप्यूटर कम्स इन टू द पिक्चर टू ओवरकम द प्रॉब्लम ऑ बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम में हम नोटबुक के अंदर रजिस्टर के अंदर डाटा स्टोर करके रखते थे तो जब कंप्यूटर आया तो इस प्रॉब्लम को हटा दिया गया बुक एंड फाइल को गायब कर दिया गया ठीक है और इसको लोग इस्तेमाल करने लगे अपने डाटा को कंप्यूटर के अंदर स्टोर करके रखने लगे तो इसका एडवांटेज क्या था कि कंप्यूटर में डाटा था मतलब हम इजली बैकअप ले सकते थे ठीक है एडिट कर सकते हैं रिमोट एक्सेस कर सकते हैं क्योंकि डाटा सिस्टम में है तो एक सिस्टम से दूसरे सिस्टम में हम लोग कैरी कर सकते थे डाटा को पेन ड्राइव के थ्रू भी शेयरिंग एंड पोर्टेबिलिटी का फैसिलिटी था ठीक है क्योंकि डाटा हमारे डिवाइस में था ठीक है लेकिन इसमें भी कुछ ड्रॉबैक थे जैसे सिक्योरिटी प्रॉब्लम था डेटा रिडंडेंसी का प्रॉब्लम था यानी डुप्लीकेसी का प्रॉब्लम डुप्लीकेट डाटा अगर हम रख देते हैं तो लगता कि एक ही पर्सन का डेटा है इंडेक्सिंग का प्रॉब्लम था यानी फास्ट सर्चिंग अवेलेबल नहीं था ओके डाटा रिट्रीव का प्रॉब्लम था तो इसमें हम डाटा कैसे रखते थे आप अपने सिस्टम में नोटपैड अगर आप ओपन करेंगे नोटपैड में अगर आप किसी भी पर्सन का इंफॉर्मेशन स्टोर करेंगे ठीक है हम आपको करके दिखाएंगे प्रैक्टिकली तो वो एग्जांपल होगा हमारे फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम के यानी फाइल क्रिएट करके कंप्यूटर के अंदर अगर हम डाटा रख रहे हैं तो वो होगा फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम तो अभी चलो इसका भी हम प्रैक्टिकल देख लेते हैं तो यह हमारा एग्जांपल है फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम का तो आप देखो यहां पे फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम में डाटा हमारे कंप्यूटर के अंदर ही है लेकिन यह डाटा को हम क्या किए हैं एक फाइल क्रिएट किए हैं और उस फाइल के अंदर यह डाटा हमारा स्टोर है देखो कंप्यूटर में हम एक फाइल बनाए हैं टेक्स्ट फाइल और इसी टेक्स्ट फाइल के अंदर हमारा डाटा देखो इस फॉर्म में है बुक एंड फाइल सिस्टम में यही डाटा हमारे नोटबुक में था ठीक है रजिस्टर में था और फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम में कंप्यूटर आ गया था तो वही डाटा कंप्यूटर में हम इस फॉर्म में रखते थे ठीक है तो इसका भी कुछ ड्रॉबैक था ओके जैसे यहां पे डाटा रिट्रीव का प्रॉब्लम था और सिक्योरिटी था लेकिन यहां पे कुछ एडवांटेज हमें मिल गया कि हम डाटा का बैकअप ले सकते थे नेटवर्क के थ्रू हम लोग शेयर कर सकते थे शेयरिंग था यहां पर तो यह हो गया हमारा फ्लैट फाइल सिस्टम अब हम क्या करेंगे अब हम देखेंगे हमारा अगला देखो यहां पर डिसएडवांटेज लिखा हुआ है फ्लैट फाइल का जो अभी हमने डिस्कस करा रिटेबल प्रॉब्लम सिक्योरिटी प्रॉब्लम रिडंडेंसी यानी डुप्लीकेसी का प्रॉब्लम सर्चिंग फास्ट सर्चिंग का प्रॉब्लम ठीक है और इंटीग्रिटी का मतलब क्या होता है कि डटा प्रॉपर्ली मेंटेन नहीं रहता है ओके अब हम बात करेंगे थर्ड टेक्निक डाटा स्टोर करने का जो कि आज के टाइम पर प्रोफेशनल लोग इस्तेमाल करते हैं डेटाबेस ठीक है डेटाबेस का इस्तेमाल करने का सबसे पहला तरीका यह है कि यह सिक्योर होता है यह हमें सिक्योरिटी प्रोवाइड करता है दूसरा यह कि इसके लिए आपको प्रॉपर नॉलेज होना चाहिए तभी आप डेटाबेस को इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं ठीक है क्योंकि इसमें एसक्यूएल लैंग्वेज का इस्तेमाल होता है क्वेरी होती है तो प्रोफेशनल और टेक्निकल पर्सन ही डेटाबेस इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं ठीक है नन टेक्निकल वालों के लिए फ्लैट फाइल और बुक फाइल सिस्टम आज भी है वो लोग करते हैं तो यह डेटाबेस होता क्या है मान लो हमारे पास डिटेल से थोड़ी देर पहले भी हमने बताया था इनको अगर हमें स्टोर करना है तो हम क्या करेंगे डेटाबेस यूज़ करेंगे डेटाबेस कुछ भी हो सकता है रकल माय सीक्वल मंगो डीबी ठीक है तो हम इनको क्या करेंगे इसमें स्टोर कर देंगे और जब जरूरत पड़ेगा यहां से डाटा एक्सेस कर लेंगे ठीक है और डाटाबेस हमें सिक्योरिटी देता है तो एडवांटेज में देख लो रिट्रीव का प्रॉब्लम बहुत इजी होता है आप क्वेरी फायर करेंगे आप एक डाटा भी रिट्रीव कर सकते हैं सारे डाटा भी एक बार में ही रिट्रीव कर सकते हैं सिक्योर होता है डेटाबेस पहले आपको क्रेडेंशियल देके कनेक्ट करना होगा उसके बाद ही आप डेटाबेस में एक्सेस कर पाएंगे डाटा को रिडंडेंसी का प्रॉब्लम यहां पर चला गया यानी आप डुप्लीकेट डाटा भी डेटाबेस में स्टोर कर सकते हैं और यूनिक एक्सेस कर सकते हैं डाटा सेम रहेगा फिर भी इंटीग्रिटी मतलब प्रॉपर्ली डेटा मेंटेन रहता है डेटाबेस के अंदर प्रैक्टिकल जब हम करेंगे तो वहां पे देखिएगा एक प्रॉपर स्ट्रक्चर वे में डाटा रहता है ठीक है इंडेक्सिंग यानी फास्ट सर्चिंग का टेक्निक होता है डेटाबेस के पास ठीक है तो यह डेटाबेस का एडवांटेज होता है याद रखिएगा डेटाबेस क्या है जहां पे हम लोग डाटा स्टोर करते हैं प्लेस है एक और डीबीएमएस क्या है डीबीएमएस एक मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम है जो कि हमें बताता है कि डेटाबेस को कैसे हैंडल करना है कैसे उसके साथ काम करना है कैसे उसको मैनेज करना है ठीक है वो डीबीएमएस बताता है इसीलिए डीबीएमएस में डेटाबेस बार-बार आपको सुनने के लिए मिलेगा तो आपको कंफ्यूज नहीं होना है डेटाबेस और डीबीएमएस में ओके अब हम डिस्कस करेंगे डीबीएमएस क्या होता है यह हमारा मेन टॉपिक है ठीक है अभी तक हमने आप आपको डाटा और डेटाबेस के बारे में बताया और कितने तरीके से हम डाटा को स्टोर कर सकते थे वह सब डिस्कस करा ताकि आपको डीबीएमएस को समझने में प्रॉब्लम ना हो तो ये डीबीएमएस क्या होता है सिंपल वर्ड में आप याद रखिएगा ये एक वे है जो कि हमें बताता है कि हम कैसे डेटाबेस को मैनेज कर सकते हैं अपने डाटा को स्टोर करने के लिए अलग-अलग तरह के डेटाबेस होते हैं तो हर डेटाबेस को मैनेज करने का अलग-अलग वे है तो उन डेटा बेसेस को मैनेज करने के लिए डीबीएमएस होता है ठीक है तो देखो यहां पे डीबीएमएस का पूरा नेम क्या है डीबीएमएस स्टैंड्स फॉर डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम इट इज द सॉफ्टवेयर डिजाइंड टू क्रिएट मैनेज एंड इंटरेक्ट विद डेटा बेसेस डेटा बेसेस के साथ इंटरेक्ट करने के लिए डेटाबेस को डिजाइन करने के लिए यानी क्रिएट करने के लिए मैनेज करने के लिए एक सॉफ्टवेयर होता है उसका नाम है डीबीएमएस ठीक है और डीबीएमएस के अंदर ही सारे डेटा बेसेस आते हैं ठीक है अलग-अलग तरीके के वो हम अभी थोड़ी देर में डिस्कस करेंगे अभी आप याद क्या रखोगे इट प्रोवाइड्स अ सिस्टमिक वे टू स्टोर ीव एंड मैनिपुलेट डाटा बाय इंश्योरिटी इंटीग्रिटी सिक्योरिटी एंड एक्सेसिबिलिटी डीबीएमएस हमें एक सिस्टेमेटाइज्ड ठीक है अब यहां पे देखो वाइल द डीबीएमएस इंट्रोड्यूस सेट ऑफ डाटा मॉडल्स आर अराइव्ड इन मार्केट दे आर लिस्टेड बिलो जब डीबीएमएस इंट्रोड्यूस हुआ मार्केट में आया तो बहुत सारे मॉडल आए डीबीएमएस के पहला मॉडल था आरडीबीएमएस यानी रिलेशनल डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम ठीक है सेकंड हो गया नो सीक्वल डीबीएमएस ओके फिर हो गया हमारा एच डीबीएमएस यानी रिकल डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम एन डीबीएमएस नेटवर्क डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम और ऑब्जेक्ट ओरिएंटेड डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम तो ये फाइव मॉडल्स है डीबीएमएस के ठीक है तो हम क्या करेंगे आरडीबीएमएस को सबसे पहले डिस्कस करेंगे कि यह क्या होता है ठीक है तो यहां पे देख लो आरडीबीएमएस का पूरा नाम होता है रिलेशनल डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम यह क्या करता है आरडीबीएमएस टेबुलर फॉर्मेट में डाटा स्टोर करता है यानी रो एंड कॉलम के फॉर्म में एग्जांपल के लिए ओरेकल माय सीक्वल पोस्टग्रे एसक्यूएल जैसे डेटाबेस को अगर आप यूज करेंगे तो आप इन डेटाबेस के अंदर एक चीज नोटिस करेंगे कि डाटा हमारा टेबल के फॉर्म में स्टोर होता है ठीक है तो अलग-अलग तरह के डेटाबेस होते हैं और इन अलग-अलग तरह के डेटाबेस को मैनेज करने के लिए डीबीएमएस होता है ठीक है तो हम क्या करेंगे प्रैक्टिकली आपको शो करेंगे डेटाबेस में डाटा स्टोर करने से पहले हमें क्या करना होगा अपने डेटाबेस के साथ कनेक्ट होना पड़ेगा तो यहां पे देखो हम अपना यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड का इस्तेमाल करके अपने ओरेकल डेटाबेस से कनेक्ट हो चुके हैं तो हम यहां पे ओरेकल डेटाबेस का इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं अपने डाटा को स्टोर करने के लिए तो सबसे पहले हमें डेटाबेस में एक टेबल क्रिएट करना होगा स्ट्रक्चर बनाना होगा और उसी स्ट्रक्चर फॉर्म में हम लोग क्या कर सकते हैं डाटा स्टोर कर सकते हैं तो यहां हम स्टूडेंट नाम का एक टेबल बना लिए हैं ठीक है अगर आप देखना चाहो तो आप इस तरीके से डीएससी स्टूडेंट यानी टेबल का नेम देक देख सकते हैं यह हमारे टेबल का स्ट्रक्चर है अब इसी स्ट्रक्चर का इस्तेमाल करके हम लोग क्या कर सकते हैं डाटा इंसर्ट कर सकते हैं ठीक है तो इंसर्ट के लिए हमें इंसर्ट वाला क्वेरी फायर करना पड़ेगा तो यह रहा हमारा इंसर्ट वाला क्वेरी तो देखो यहां पर वन रो क्रिएटेडॉक्युमेंट्सफ्रैगमेंट ठीक है तो और भी रिकॉर्ड इंसर्ट करने के लिए यहां पर क्वेरी है हमारा इंसर्ट वाला तो हम लोग क्या करेंगे यह थर्ड रिकॉर्ड आ गए अब अगर हमें देखना है कि हमारे टेबल में कितने रिकॉर्ड हैं तो इस तरीके से हम लोग क्या कर सकते हैं सेलेक्ट स्टार फ्रॉम टेबल नेम देके यहां पर देख सकते हैं तो यह देखो हमारा एक स्ट्रक्चर्ड वे में डेटाबेस में हमने डाटा स्टोर करा है तो डेटाबेस का एडवांटेज क्या है कि यह हमारा पूरी तरह से सिक्योर्ड है यानी हम डेटाबेस से कनेक्ट होंगे अपना ेंशियल देके तभी हम डेटाबेस को एक्सेस कर पाएंगे और कनेक्ट होने के बाद अगर टेबल है तो इस क्वेरी के थ्रू हम डाटा रिट्रीव कर सकते हैं कुछ मॉडिफिकेशन परफॉर्म कराना हो तो वो सब भी कर सकते हैं हम लोग अगर आपको डेटाबेस ओरेकल पढ़ना है तो हमारी कंप्लीट प्लेलिस्ट आपको डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिल जाएगी वहां से आप देख सकते हैं ठीक है तो इस वीडियो का मोटो ये है कि डेटाबेस में डाटा कैसे स्टोर होता है वो बताना ठीक है तो हमने ओरेकल का इस्तेमाल करके आपको यह बता दिया कि इस तरीके से हम लोग रो कॉलम के फॉर्म में टेबुलर में डाटा स्टोर करते हैं ठीक है डेटाबेस में अब हम बात करेंगे नो सीक्वल डीबीएमएस के बारे में तो यह क्या होता है इसमें अनस्ट्रक्चर्ड फॉर्मेट में डाटा स्टोर होता है यानी आपके पास बस डाटा होना चाहिए आप डाटा लेके आओ और इसमें स्टोर कर दो तो मोंगो डीबी हो गया हमारा एग्जांपल नो सीक्वल डेटाबेस का बेस्ट एग्जांपल रेडिज हो गया और भी बहुत सारे होते हैं तो इन सभी डेटाबेस का मेन एडवांटेज क्या होता है कि ये आपको ये नहीं कहेंगे कि पहले आप एक प्रॉपर स्ट्रक्चर डिफाइन करो उसके बाद डाटा स्टोर करो नहीं आप लाउड डाटा यहां पे स्टोर कर दो थर्ड हो गया हमारा एच डीबीएमएस ये क्या होता है राल डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम इसमें क्या होता है ट्री के फॉर्म में हम लोग डाटा स्टोर करते हैं ऑर्गेनाइजेशनल स्ट्रक्चर जैसे यहां पे आप देख लो आप किसी भी ऑर्गेनाइजेशन में अगर कोई काम करता है तो कंपनी में एंप्लॉई का एक हायर की होता है वो हायर की का नेचर क्या होता है मान के चलो कि यह हो गया मैनेजर ठीक है और इस मैनेजर के अंडर में बहुत सारे एंप्लॉई काम कर रहे हैं और इस एंप्लॉई के अंदर भी बहुत सारे एंप्लॉई काम कर रहे हैं तो इस तरीके से एक हायरर की होता है ठीक है तो रिकल वे में अगर डाटा स्टोर हो रहा है ट्री के फॉर्म में तो वो हो गया हमारा एचडी बीएमएस तो यहां पे आप याद क्या रखेंगे ऑन द बेसिस ऑफ एडी बीएमएस आईबीएम लच द फर्स्ट एडी बीएमएस सॉफ्टवेयर आईएमएस ठीक है आईबीएम एक ऑर्गेनाइजेशन है जो कि एक एडीबीएस के ऊपर ही सॉफ्टवेयर इसने लाया आईएमएस इंफॉर्मेशन मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम 1960 में जिसका इस्तेमाल करके हम लोग रिकल फॉर्म में क्या करते हैं डाटा स्टोर करते हैं ठीक है तो इसका डिसएडवांटेज क्या होता है कि इट प्रोवाइड्स डेटा रिट्रीव प्रॉब्लम ठीक है इट वाज बेस्ड ऑन वन टू मेनी रिलेशनशिप द स्ट्रक्चरल हायरा कल डाटा मॉडल इज वेरी कॉम्प्लेक्शन है इसमें डाटा को रिट्रीव करना डिफिकल्ट है ओके इसमें वन टू मेनी रिलेशनशिप होते है यानी यहां पे देख लो यरार की जो बनी हुई थी एक मैनेजर है उसके अंदर बहुत सारे एंप्लॉई काम कर रहे हैं फिर उनके अंदर बहुत लोग कर रहे हैं तो इस हायर की को मेंटेन करना बहुत डिफिकल्ट है ये डिसएडवांटेज होते हैं हायर की डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम का अब हम बात करेंगे एन डीबीएमएस के बारे में नेटवर्क डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम यह क्या होता है स्टोर डाटा इन ग्राफिकल स्ट्रक्चर ठीक है ग्राफ के फॉर्म में डाटा स्टोर होता है हमारे नेटवर्क डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम में वेयर नोट्स आर डायरेक्टली कनेक्टेड टू ईच अदर हर एक नोट दूसरे नोट से डायरेक्टली कनेक्ट होते हैं जैसे यहां पे देखो एक ग्राफ बना हुआ है यूनिवर्सिटी यूनिवर्सिटी के अंदर बहुत सारे डिपार्टमेंट होते हैं तो हर एक डिपार्टमेंट एक दूसरे से कनेक्टेड होते हैं डायरेक्टली कंप्यूटर डिपार्टमेंट कंप्यूटर लैब से भी कनेक्टेड होता है लाइब्रेरी से भी होता है ठीक है लाइब्रेरी हमारा इससे भी कनेक्ट होता है इस तरीके से और यह भी हमारा इससे भी कनेक्ट हो सकता है ओके इस तरीके से नहीं इस वे में कनेक्ट रहेगा तो इसमें हर एक डिपार्टमेंट एक दूसरे से कनेक्टेड होते हैं एक ऑर्गेनाइजेशन के अंदर तो वो होता है हमारा नेटवर्क डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम और इसी प्रॉब्लम के लिए क्या हुआ था कि एक ऑर्गेनाइजेशन कोडा सल ने एक सॉफ्टवेयर लच किया था इसी हायर की को मेंटेन करने के लिए ठीक है तो यहां पे ऑन द बेसिस ऑफ दिस मॉडल नेटवर्क डेटाबेस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम मॉडल कोडा सल स्टैंडर्ड ऑर्गेनाइजेशन प्रोवाइड्स अस आईडीएस आईडीएस एक सॉफ्टवेयर है इंटीग्रेटेड डटा स्टोर डेटाबेस सॉफ्टवेयर ठीक है 1964 में इसने लॉन्च करा था ओके तो इसका इस्तेमाल करके हम लोग क्या करते थे एन डीबीएमएस के थ्रू क्या करते थे अपने डाटा को स्टोर करते थे और मैनेज करते थे लेकिन इसमें प्रॉब्लम क्या होता था कि हमें पॉइंटर का इस्तेमाल करके सारे रिकॉर्ड्स को मेंटेन करना हो होता था जिससे हमारा कंप्लीट जो अ ये एनडीबीए एस का स्ट्रक्चर होता था वो कॉम्प्लेक्टेड फिकेशन परफॉर्म करना होता था इंसर्ट डिलीट एंड डीबीएमएस के अंदर तो वो बहुत कॉम्प्लेक्शन के थ्रू एडजस्टमेंट करना होता था मान लो कुछ रिकॉर्ड इंसर्ट करने हैं डिलीट करने हैं तो वो डिफिकल्ट होता था और स्ट्रक्चरल चेंज टू द डेटाबेस इज वेरी डिफिकल्ट अगर मान लो ये एक स्ट्रक्चर बन गया ग्राफ बन गया है हमारे डाटा का ठीक है अब ये डेटाबेस में स्टोर हो गया जिसको चेंज करना बहुत डिफिकल्ट होता था ओके तो ये हो गया हमारा एनडीबीए एस और इसके कुछ ड्रॉबैक्स अभी तक हमने जो भी डिस्कस कर रहा है चलिए उसको एक बार हम लोग रिकैपिंग और डीबीएमएस क्या है डीबीएमएस एक मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम है जो कि एक वे है जो हमें बताता है कि हम अपने अलग-अलग तरह के डेटा बेसेस को जैसे ओरेकल मा सीक्वल मोंगो डीवी इन तरीके के डेटा बेसेस को हम कैसे मैनेज कर सकते हैं कैसे इनके साथ हम लोग काम कर सकते हैं इंटरेक्ट कर सकते हैं वो हमें बताता है डीबीएमएस ठीक है इसीलिए डीबीएमएस में आपको डाटा और डेटाबेस दोनों वर्ड भी सुनने के लिए मिलेंगे तो उम्मीद करते हैं आपको हमारा वीडियो पसंद आया होगा अगर आया हो तो वीडियो को लाइक करिएगा शेयर करिएगा चैनल पे नए हैं सब्सक्राइब करिए गया'"

      "**Overview**  \n",
      "The video introduces the concept of a Database Management System (DBMS), explaining why it is essential, how it evolved from earlier data‑storage methods, and what benefits it brings. It covers the definition of a database, the role of a DBMS, the main types of DBMS, their pros and cons, and gives a practical Oracle example to illustrate typical operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Main Points  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Need for a DBMS** – Data must be stored and managed efficiently; a DBMS provides the tools to add, update, delete, and retrieve records securely.  \n",
      "2. **What a database is** – A structured, organized collection of data that can be accessed and manipulated electronically.  \n",
      "3. **Evolution of data storage** – From paper ledgers → flat files → modern database systems, each step addressing issues of retrieval speed, redundancy, security, and integrity.  \n",
      "4. **Definition of a DBMS** – Software that creates, manages, and interacts with databases, ensuring consistency, security, and accessibility.  \n",
      "5. **Types of DBMS** –  \n",
      "   - Relational (tables, SQL)  \n",
      "   - NoSQL (document, key‑value, columnar, graph)  \n",
      "   - Hierarchical (tree structure)  \n",
      "   - Network (graph of records)  \n",
      "   - Object‑oriented (direct object storage)  \n",
      "6. **Advantages** – Security, data integrity, reduced redundancy, fast retrieval, concurrent access, backup/recovery.  \n",
      "7. **Disadvantages** – Complexity, performance overhead, cost, learning curve.  \n",
      "8. **Practical Oracle example** – Step‑by‑step commands for connecting, creating a table, inserting, querying, updating, and deleting data.  \n",
      "9. **Summary recap** – Distinguishing data, database, and DBMS; highlighting the value and challenges of using a DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Supporting Details  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Data examples**: names, addresses, numbers.  \n",
      "- **Database example**: a student table with fields like name, roll number, address, contact, gender.  \n",
      "- **Historical drawbacks**: physical books caused slow retrieval, loss, and maintenance problems; flat files lacked security, indexing, and consistency.  \n",
      "- **DBMS features**: structured schemas, authentication, constraints, transactions, indexing, query optimization.  \n",
      "- **Oracle commands**: `CONNECT`, `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.  \n",
      "- **DBMS type specifics**: relational systems excel with structured data and SQL; NoSQL offers flexible schemas and horizontal scaling but weaker consistency; hierarchical and network models suit specific relationship patterns; object‑oriented DBMS aligns with OO programming but is less common.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Takeaways  \n",
      "\n",
      "- A **DBMS is the “manager”** that controls how data is stored, accessed, and protected within a database.  \n",
